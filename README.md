## Angular Shopping Cart
This is one of the first projects that we got assigned to complete and build with AngularJS.  We had to make a shopping cart that had an admin side to be able to edit the products and then we had to have a customer side to be able to purchase the products. If you have any questions please feel free to reach me at Christopher.R.Otten@gmail.com
